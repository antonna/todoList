# todoList
A simple todo list using a forEach loop listing the todo's and we can pass on 
a second argument refering to the index of every item that is passed in.

Another function of the list is the use of splice that enables the deletion of 
an item from the array. Splice takes two arguments in this app. The position of
the item in the array to be deleted and how many itemns should be deleted after 
that index.
